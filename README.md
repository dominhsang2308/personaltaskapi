# personal_task_api

A small Flask-based personal task API.

Quick start

1. Create a virtual environment and install dependencies:

```
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

2. Run the app:

```
python main.py
```

3. Tests / database

The project includes `test.db` — be sure to add it to `.gitignore` before pushing if you don't want it tracked.
